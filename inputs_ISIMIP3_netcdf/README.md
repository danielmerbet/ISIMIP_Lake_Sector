# Final collection of netcdf files containing the representative lakes information for ISIMIP3 global lake runs  <br />

**[Alternative_inputs]:** Area (km2), volume (km3), and maximum and mean depth (m) of the representative lakes. <br />

**[Hypsographic_curves]:** Hypsographic curves for area and volume for the representative lakes. Each hypsographic curve consist of 11 data pairs relating level (bottom of the lake as the reference, in meters) with area (km2) or volume (km3).  <br />

**[Water_area_per_pixel]:** netcdf files containing the yearly fraction of water area of lakes per pixel (%) according to dates of construction of dams from 1850. <br />

**[Reference]:** netcdf files containing reference information for the representative lakes, and layers to produce global plots with conspicuous big lakes
